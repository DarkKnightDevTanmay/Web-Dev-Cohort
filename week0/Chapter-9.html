            <td>MP4 is one of the most widely used video formats, known for its high compression and excellent video quality. It is compatible with almost all devices and platforms. MP4 files typically use the H.264 codec for video and AAC codec for audio.</td>
            <td>WebM is an open-source video format that provides high-quality video compression. It is designed to be used on the web, and it's supported by modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. WebM uses the VP8 or VP9 video codec and the Vorbis or Opus audio codec.</td>
            <td>AVI is a multimedia container format developed by Microsoft. It is known for high video and audio quality but often results in large file sizes. AVI files can contain video encoded with various codecs such as DivX, XviD, or MJPEG.</td>

            <td>MP3 is one of the most popular and widely supported audio formats. It uses lossy compression to reduce file size while maintaining relatively high audio quality. It is commonly used for music and audio streaming.</td>
            <td>WAV is an uncompressed audio format that retains the highest quality sound. It is often used in professional audio recording, editing, and archiving because it does not lose any data during compression. However, WAV files are large compared to other formats.</td>
            <td>OGG is an open-source, lossy audio format that provides good sound quality with smaller file sizes than MP3. It is commonly used for streaming and is supported by many media players.</td>
